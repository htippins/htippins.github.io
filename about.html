          Hello, my name is Holly. I currently work as a mental health nurse in
          the NHS. I started to re-evaluate my future as a nurse towards the end
          of 2021. I'd worked throughout the covid-19 pandemic and experienced
          first-hand the crisis the mental health system in the UK is facing
          (and more broadly the NHS). I made the decision to pursue a career in
          <span style="color: rgb(251, 195, 61)">web development</span> after
          consideration about what the future of nursing looked like to me.<br /><br />
          My life-long interest in
          <span style="color: rgb(251, 195, 61)">computers and tech</span> drove
          me towards wanting to dig deeper into the world of programming. I
          started my journey using self-teaching using platforms like Udemy and
          freeCodeCamp, and I haven't looked back. <br /><br />
          I started formal education in January 2022 at the Univeristy of
          Northumbria to study
          <span style="color: rgb(251, 195, 61)"
            >Computer Science with a focus on Data Analytics</span
          >. I cut down my hours at work and focus the other 50% of my time on
          developing my programming skills.<br /><br />
          I have taken a brief break in my studies to embark on the CODE
          Lanacshire bootcamp with the intention to start working
          <span style="color: rgb(251, 195, 61)">full-time as a developer</span>
          upon completion.

          I love music! I'm self-taught on the guitar and love going to see live
